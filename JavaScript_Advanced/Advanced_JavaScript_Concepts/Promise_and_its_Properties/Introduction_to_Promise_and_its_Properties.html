    <h3>Introduction to Promise & its Properties</h3> 
    <p>
        1.      There are two types of code in asynchronous programming: <br>

Producer Code: The code that produces some result <br>
Consumer Code: The code that consumes the result produced by the producer code <br>
2.      A promise is an object which makes the result produced by the producer code available to the consumer code, thus linking them together.
<br>

3.      The producer code is contained inside the promise object.
 
<br>
4.     The producer code, which is inside the promise object, contains resolve & reject callbacks.
<br>

5.      The producer code is executed as soon as the promise object is created. You do not need to explicitly call the producer code.
